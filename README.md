> General App Requirements

**Discussion Points:**
- **Ilhan:** Is the app only for students or do the vendors also use it?  
  **A:** The app will be used by both vendors and students. Each group will have their own interface to avoid interference.

  **A:** We will use **Flutter** for the app, and **SQLite** or **MongoDB** as the database.

- **Aiman:** For data gathering (elicitation), which route are we taking?  
  **A:** Surveys will be used for mass data collection. Additionally, we’ll either create a prototype or conduct market research on similar apps.
