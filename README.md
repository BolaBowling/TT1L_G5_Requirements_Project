Date : 17th May 2025
Mode : Online
Platform : Discord
Participants : All 

Agenda : General App Requirements

Points Made During The Meeting : 
ILHAN | Is the app only for students or do the vendors also use it?
A  - The app can be used both by the vendors and the students. Each of them will have their own interface so as not to interfere with the operations of one another.

FAIZ | How would account logins work? Do the vendors have to register themselves?
A -  Students will have to login using their Clic account while the vendors can register themselves using the link provided by the admins or they can use an account provided by the admins.

AQIL | Which language are we using for the project? 
A - We will use Flutter for the app, and either SQLIte or MongoDB for the database (just wanna try some new stuff)

AIMAN | For the data gathering part (Elicitation), which route are we taking?
A - We are definitely using surveys for mass data gatherings. As for the second elicitation, weâ€™re thinking of either using a prototype or doing market research on similar apps.

Work Done During The Meeting : 
Finalised the app requirements, and use cases that are gonna be used in the report. Chose the language and DBMS that the software is going to be built with. Clarified what exactly we are building and what the end product should look like.
